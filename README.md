# basic-scraper

This project will scrape the [King County Restaurant Inspection](http://info.kingcounty.gov/health/ehs/foodsafety/inspections/) website and return a text file with inspection data. You can change the settings for different date ranges and different zipcodes.

This version is a modified version forked from [Efrain Camacho](https://github.com/efrainc/basic_scraper/tree/step1).
